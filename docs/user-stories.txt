User Stories


User stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift
the focus from writing about requirements to talking about
them. All agile user stories include a written sentence or
two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about
the desired functionality.


What is a user story?
=====================
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature
told from the perspective of the person who desires the
new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
They typically follow a simple template:

As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes,
stored in a shoe box, and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate
planning and discussion.  As such, they strongly shift the focus
from writing about features to discussing them.  In fact, these
discussions are more important than whatever text is written.


Can you show some user story examples?
======================================
One of the benefits of agile user stories is that they can be written
at varying levels of detail.  We can write a user story to cover large
amounts of functionality.  These large user stories are generally known
as epics.  Here is an epic agile user story example from a desktop
backup product:

o As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive.

Because an epic is generally too large for an agile team to complete in
one iteration, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before it
is worked on.  The epic above could be split into dozens (or possibly
hundreds), including these two:

o As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on
  file size, date created and date modified.

o As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup
  drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.


How is detail added to user stories?
====================================
Detail can be added to user stories in two ways:
o By splitting a user story into multiple, smaller user stories.
o By adding “conditions of satisfaction.”

When a relatively large story is split into multiple, smaller
agile user stories, it is natural to assume that detail has
been added. After all, more has been written.

The conditions of satisfaction is simply a high-level acceptance
test that will be true after the agile user story is complete.
Consider the following as another agile user story example:

As a vice president of marketing, I want to select a holiday
season to be used when reviewing the performance of past
advertising campaigns so that I can identify profitable ones.

Detail could be added to that user story example by adding the
following conditions of satisfaction:

o Make sure it works with major retail holidays: Christmas,
  Easter, President’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day,
  Labor Day, New Year’s Day.

o Support holidays that span two calendar years (none span three).

o Holiday seasons can be set from one holiday to the next (such
  as Thanksgiving to Christmas).

o Holiday seasons can be set to be a number of days prior to the holiday.
